        <article class="educationArticle">
            <p>In 2018 I have graduated from high school â„–115 in Minsk. In this school I have studying music, but my school did not give a diploma of musical education and for this reason I graduated from a music school as an external student. 
                After scool I entered the Faculty of Philology of BSU and next two years I had been studying bulgarian language. In 2020, when the pandemy of covid-19 started, I decided, that philology doesn't attract me anymore and I need to reentered another faculty. 
                Scince autumn 2020 I'm the student of Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer technologies of BSU and now I ended first year. This summer I started stage0 front-end cours from RS-school and now I'm on the stage1.</p>
